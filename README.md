Uniform Standards for External Facing Repositories

We maintain a number of public repositories that help customers to run various workloads on Packet. These repositories are in various states of completeness and quality, and being public, developers often find them and start using them. This creates problems:

* Developers using low-quality repositories may infer that Packet generally provides a low quality experience.
* Many of our repositories are put online with no formal communication with, or training for, customer success. This leads to a below average support experience when things do go wrong.
* We spend a huge amount of time supporting users through various channels when with better upfront planning, documentation and testing much of this support work could be eliminated.
