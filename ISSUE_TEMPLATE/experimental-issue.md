If you feel the repository should be maintained or end of life or that you'll need assistance to create these files, please let us know by filing an issue with https://github.com/packethost/standards.

Equinix Metal maintains a number of public repositories that help customers to run various workloads on Equinix Metal. These repositories are in various states of completeness and quality, and being public, developers often find them and start using them. This creates problems:

* Developers using low-quality repositories may infer that Equinix Metal generally provides a low quality experience.
* Many of our repositories are put online with no formal communication with, or training for, customer success. This leads to a below average support experience when things do go wrong.
* We spend a huge amount of time supporting users through various channels when with better upfront planning, documentation and testing much of this support work could be eliminated.

To that end, we propose three tiers of repositories: [Private](https://github.com/packethost/standards#private-tier-minimum-requirements), [Experimental](https://github.com/packethost/standards#experimental-tier-minimum-requirements), and [Maintained](https://github.com/packethost/standards#maintained-tier-minimum-requirements).

As a resource and example of a maintained repository, we've created https://github.com/packethost/standards. This is also where you can file any requests for assistance or modification of scope.

### The Goal
Our repositories should be the example from which adjacent, competing, projects look for inspiration.

Each repository should not look entirely different from other repositories in the ecosystem, having a different layout, a different testing model, or a different logging model, for example, without reason or recommendation from the subject matter experts from the community.

We should share our improvements with each ecosystem while seeking and respecting the feedback of these communities.

Whether or not strict guidelines have been provided for the project type, our repositories should ensure that the same components are offered across the board. How these components are provided may vary, based on the conventions of the project type. GitHub provides general guidance on this which they have integrated into their user experience.
