# Equinix Labs GitHub Organization

## Purpose
### What it is

* A GitHub Organization with the URL https://github.com/equinix-labs
* Owned by Equinix
* An Org that is intended to support both public and private repositories. 
* A place which is relatively un-opinionated as to what it should be used for, but relatively opinionated on how it should be used. 

### Why you might use it
(This is not an exhaustive list.)
* To share code between Equinic developer and Equinix customers.
* To share code between Equinix developers.
* To host code that is provided alongside guides, workshops etc.
* To incubate things that are somewhat experimental.

## Governance and Ownership
### Governance
A set of rules/guidelines and a code of conduct are available and must be followed. Use of the Organization will be considered to indicate acceptance of these. In the case of any conflict between rules set in the Organization and those set by Equinix centrally, the central rules will be definitive. 

Some amount of required behavior/structure may be enforced through templating, restrictions or automation. This will be decided by Administrators of the Equinix Labs GitHub Org. 

Access security will be managed: 
* Automatically using SSO for Equinix users.
* Manually by administrators for external users

### Ownership
The GitHub Organization will be co-owned by its users within Equinix.  

Administrators will collaborate to make changes in the governance and to the Organization from time to time. Administrators are volunteers from within Equinix and we anticipate approximately one per team that uses the Org. 

#### Intended users and permissions

##### Equinix Users
Internal contributors (e.g. developers, content authors).
* Log in via SSO.
* Can create, read, update and delete repos. 

Admin
* Are distributed across the company and have a special interest. 
* Have additional administrative rights to add external contributors etc. 

#### External 
Visitors
* Can can look and interact in non-destructive ways (read, fork etc).
	
Contributors
* Must be granted permission from admin to be able to write etc. 

## Maintenance and Support
### Maintenance

* Maintenance of individual repos must be undertaken by the repo owner.
* Equinix Labs Administrator will meet from time to time to agree changes to the management of the Org and its repos, as well as determining whether any repos need remedial work. A chair of the group may be nominated to ensure continuity of process.
* A repo containing useful templates, information and a code of conduct will be jointly owned and maintained by the Administrators.

### Support

* The repo owner takes responsibility for indicating how users should use the repo and how they will support the repo through inclusion of a set of mandatory files, for example:
  * [README.md](glossary.md#README.md)
  * [OWNERS.md](glossary.md#OWNERS.md)
  * [LICENSE](glossary.md#LICENSE)
  * [CODEOWNERS](glossary.md#CODEOWNERS)
  * [CONTRIBUTING.md](glossary.md#CONTRIBUTING.md)
  * [SUPPORT.md](glossary.md#SUPPORT.md)
